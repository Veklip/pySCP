pySCP - A Python implementation of the SCP protocol

The idea behind it is to expand the scp functionality a bit without going
into the area of sftp and rsync (much :)), and also to make it platform-
independant.

SCP protocol pseudo-example:
sink  : 0 # ready to recieve
source: T<unix mtime> 0 <unix atime> 0 # optional (-p)
sink  : 0 # confirm
source: D0xxx 0 <dir name> # if sending a directory
sink  : 0
source: T<unix mtime> 0 <unix atime> 0
sink  : 0
source: C0xxx <size> <file name>
sink  : 0
source: <data>
source: 0 # data end
sink  : 0 # ok
source: T<unix mtime> 0 <unix atime> 0
sink  : 0
source: C0xxx <size> <file name>
sink  : 0
source: <data>
source: 0
sink  : 0
....
source: D0xxx 0 <dir name>
sink  : 0
....
source: E # confirm end of directory
sink  : 0
source: E
sink  : 0

The 'test' folder contains a simple script for testing the bone of pySCP. To
use the test, put a copy of echo_test.py and reverse_echo.py in the home
directory[1] of a remote user and then call './echo_test user@host -f'. You
should be able to get a response from the other side.

[1] For now the home directory is hard coded. I'll probably add it as a
parameter later on, but it isn't that important now.

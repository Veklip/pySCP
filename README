pySCP - A Python implementation of the SCP protocol

The idea behind it is to expand the scp functionality a bit without going
into the area of sftp and rsync (much :)), and also to make it platform-
independant.

===
The 'test' folder contains a simple script for testing the bone of pySCP. To
use the test, put a copy of echo_test.py and reverse_echo.py in the home
directory[1] of a remote user and then call './echo_test user@host -f'. You
should be able to get a response from the other side.

[1] For now the home directory is hard coded. I'll probably add it as a
parameter later on, but it isn't that important now.
